Lab: #3 - Frameworks

-------Activities completed-------
Basic Activity, Framework upgrade, Documentation

-------Problems and Incomplete Activities------- 
I am not sure if the "Framework upgrade" was implemented correctly.
I cannot seem to find any advantage in the current implementation of the upgrade compared to the GameRule implementation.
Therefore, I added persistence to my GameConditions, which defines whether a condition is always active or only until it's true for the first time.

-------AI Usage Declaration-------
I used ChatGPT *after* implementing the GameCondition/GamificationListener, to see if there were better/other ways to implement.
However, it did not give me any clues to what a better implementation could have been, so I kept my implementation.

-------Additional Comments-------
NONE

-------Points claimed-------
Basic activity: 3
Framework Upgrade +2
